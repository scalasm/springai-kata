# Spring-AI kata

This is my sandbox for working with Spring AI, and prompt engineering in general: nothing fancy, just learning!

# Requirements
- JDK 21 or better
  - I use Amazon Corretto 21 but anything should be fine
- OPENAI API Key - to be obtained by the [Open AI Console](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
  - ensure there is an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY` set and your will be ready to go!

# How to run

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## How to test

There is a [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html) available.
